# FPS Prototype - A 3D Android Game

FPS Prototype is an immersive first-person shooter (FPS) game built for Android devices. It showcases my skills as a developer and explores the potential of FPS gaming on mobile platforms. This prototype utilizes the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture for optimized performance and scalability. Explore the main menu and a small world featuring a few static enemies and one chasing enemy. Please note that as a prototype, the game currently consists of limited content and temporary assets. Thank you for joining me on this exciting journey into game development.
